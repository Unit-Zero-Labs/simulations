$$dX_t = \alpha (\gamma - X_t) dt + \beta dW_t $$


# Alpha (Œ±): Mean Reversion Rate

the rate at which the process reverts to its long-term mean. Quantifies how quickly the process responds to deviations in time

A higher alpha indicates a faster adjustment back to the mean, leading to less volatile, more stable dynamics. In this mechanism, a high alpha could suggest a token whose value is tightly controlled or regulated, quickly returning to a target or equilibrium value after fluctuations. A lower alpha might be something more speculative, like a meme token.

# Gamma (Œ≥): Long-term Mean

represents the equilibrium or mean level to which the process reverts over time

The value of ùõæ sets the target or the expected average value of the process. It does not affect the volatility or speed of mean reversion but rather where the process settles in the long run. So this could reperesent a token price or value designed by the protocol. 

# Beta (Œ≤): Volatility or Scale of the Brownian Motion

 measures the scale or intensity of the random fluctuations driven by the Brownian motion component of the process. 

A higher Œ≤ increases the range and intensity of the fluctuations, leading to a more volatile and unpredictable process.
